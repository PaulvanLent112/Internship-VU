Python code used in the data analysis and exploration of the neuronal dynamics. As some code is not mine, I will not share it yet, as it is not mine to give.

Some code is dispersed over multiple files. Therefore, if you want to set up this analysis, feel free to contact me. Most important is the functions.py file
