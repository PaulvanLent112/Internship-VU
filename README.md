Code used for the thesis: characterizing spontaneous activity in the Zebrafish brain



Summary:
This repository consists of the code used for the results in the thesis: Characterizing spontaneous activity in the Zebrafish brain. 
Content:
1. Supporting functions used in all the underlying code: some were received from the work of dr. Antonio Costa for a paper on a transfer operator approach for C. elegans postural dynamics. 
For all functions that were inspired or received from various sources, the sources are stated within the function.
2. The code used for determining K: entropy rate decrease for K.
3. PCA plots, for different K
4. Asymmetric Diffusion Map: MATLAB code from Brennan et. al (2019) NOT INCLUDED IN THIS REPOSITORY AS IT IS NOT MINE. CAN BE FOUND IN THE SUPP INFORMATION OF THE BRENNAN PAPER.
5. Spectral analysis code: (complex) eigenvectors and eigenvalues
6. Infomap: API from mapequation.org, visualization in the script
7. Spectral analysis code: comparing relaxation times between wildtype and mutant


Data:
Data was provided by the Zebrafish Development Lab at TU delft of dr. Elizabeth Carroll. For raw data, contact her.
